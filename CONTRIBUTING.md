### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: We need your help developing new features!
- **qa-needed**: We need some assistance in making sure our software is the highest quality it can be.
- **documentation-needed**: We need either completely new or more detailed documentation.
- **bug-high-priority**: This indicates a high-priority bug fix.
- **bug-low-priority**: This indicates a low-priority bug fix.
- **help-wanted**: This is perfect for new contributors - all hands on deck!

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
