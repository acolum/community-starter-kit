# Bug Report Template

------------------------------------------------

## Title

The title should explain the bug in a couple of words.

## Description

The description should include:
- steps to reproduce the issue,
- what the expected result is and what actually happens,
- the version of the software being used,
- versions of relevant external software (e.g. browser and operating system),
- explanation of what's already been done to try and fix the issue.

The more detail included in the bug report, the easier (and quicker) it is for the developer to solve the bug.
